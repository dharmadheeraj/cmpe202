1) I've usd the Observer pattern to notify the customer where the Restaurant class acts as Subject and the customers act as Observers.
I felt that this pattern fits for this use case because we can notify a list of subscribes/observers based on the business logic in our subject class. 

2) I've used state pattern to set the state of Table class.
As the tables in the restaurant can have only two defined states, i felt that tis could be the right fit here.
